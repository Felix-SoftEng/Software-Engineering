    <p>One of the software that I personally use that is designed well would be Davinci Resolve. 
      Davinci Resolve is an editing program that is known for the visual, audio, motion graphic effects all put into one neat software. 
      Its interface is clean and intuitive and allows for many new users to switch between casual editing to colour grading effects and audio mixing. 
      The user interface is customizable which enhances each person's personal experience and also tailors to a workspace environment or other specific needs. 
      Davinci is also recognized by high-end professionals working on films and television shows, making it a valuable tool for aspiring editors who want to enter the field. 
      Software design is important because it determines if programs are usable, efficient, and up to customer standards. 
      It often involves a well-designed structure that provides users' needs and other fundamental requirements that the software can be used for. 
      The software design acts as the user interface between problem and solution. Good design also ensures the software is scalable and can accommodate future updates or evolving user needs. 
      Since software design is flexible, developers can constantly add on new software without it affecting older versions. 
      This makes projects more manageable and ensures that as technology advances, software can adapt without becoming obsolete.  
      Furthermore, good software design helps reduce errors and enhances productivity by simplifying tasks, making them more accessible for users of different skill levels. 
      In the case of DaVinci Resolve, its efficient design ensures that both beginners and professionals can utilize the software’s features without being overwhelmed. 
      Overall, a well-thought-out designed program like DaVinci Resolve not only meets current needs but can also be updated for future visual and audio effects seen in new movies coming out every year.</p>

    <p>1. In the requirement gathering stage, we often ask questions based on what this software product is used for and identifying the target audience. This involves asking key questions and clarifying expectations to clients to ensure a clear understanding of the software’s purpose. 
      Effective communication skills are crucial at this stage because this lays the foundation for the entire project and what the end goal is going to be. 
      Understanding the problem at hand allows for what we’re solving to make decisions about the features, functionality, and design. This will also allow us to identify any constraints or issues early on which can impact the team’s deadlines and budgets when developing. 
      This stage makes clients and developers work together towards a similar goal to minimize the risk of miscommunication later in the development stage, which can cause costly reworks and project risks. Additionally, thorough documentation of the requirements helps keep the development process organized with the project's objectives. 
      Therefore, the requirement gathering stage is one of the most critical stages in all of software development, as it lays out the foundation and directly influences the success of the entire project.</p>

    <p>2. As a User, I would want there to be a feature to add external software effects so that I can utilize 3D modeling and music creation tools from other software.<br>
      As an Editor, I want easy access to cloud storage platforms, so that I can easily access and collaborate on projects remotely with team members. <br>
      As a Beginner, I want to have an intuitive tutorial mode or guided interface, so that I can quickly learn the tools and features without feeling overwhelmed by the software. <br>
      As an Effect Creator, I want to have a node-based visual effects editor, so that I can create custom effects by connecting different nodes for ultimate control and flexibility in my designs.<br>
