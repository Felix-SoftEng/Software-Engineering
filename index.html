  <p>One of the software that I personally use that is designed well would be Davinci Resolve. Davinci Resolve is an editing program that is known for the visual, audio, motion graphic effects all put into one neat software. 
    Its interface is clean and intuitive and allows for many new users to switch between casual editing to colour grading effects and audio mixing. 
    The user interface is customizable which enhances each person's personal experience and also tailor to a workspace environment or other specific needs. 
    Davinci is also recognized by high end professionals working on films and television shows, making it a valuable tool for aspiring editors who want to enter the field. 
    Software design is important because it determines if programs are usable, efficient and up to customer standards. It often involves a well designed structure that provides users needs and other fundamental requirements that the software can be used for. 
    The software design acts as the user interface between problem and solution. Good design also ensures the software is scalable and can accommodate future updates or evolving user needs. Since software design is flexible, developers can constantly add on new software without it affecting older versions. 
    This makes projects more manageable and ensures that as technology advances, software can adapt without becoming obsolete.  Furthermore, good software design helps reduce errors and enhances productivity by simplifying tasks, making them more accessible for users of different skill levels. 
    In the case of DaVinci Resolve, its efficient design ensures that both beginners and professionals can utilise the softwareâ€™s features without being overwhelmed. Overall, a well thought out designed program like DaVinci Resolve not only meets current needs but can also be updated for future visual and audio effects seen in new movies coming out every year.</p>
